    "text": "This half-day hands-on workshop was held at the Applied Machine Learning Days 2024 in Lausanne. It was aimed for beginners and covered introduction to machine learning and three usecases in text classification, time series forecasting and anomaly detection. It was a vibrant atmosphere in a large room with 110 seats.\nWe shared a GitHub repository to the participants that contained the python codes to run on Colab, Binder or their local machines. The room was full from start to end, and I was happy to see the enthusiasm of the participants.\nIn future I would like to have more time for the workshop to give more time for participants to work on the exercises and to interact with them."

    "text": "It was a pleasure to deliver this workshop to a dynamic group of professionals from Totsa. The session kicked off with an introduction to the fundamentals of AI and ML, where we explored key concepts, real-world applications, and the transformative potential of AI across industries. By demystifying the technical jargon and providing practical examples, the goal was to ensure participants not only grasped the basics but also developed a clearer understanding of how AI can create value in their own work environments.\nIn the second half, we shifted gears into a more interactive mode by dividing participants into small groups. Each group was tasked with brainstorming AI opportunities specific to their daily work, and we provided guidance on how to identify and frame problems AI could solve. Teams worked through their ideas, and we later helped to refine their ideas. By the end of the session, they left with a greater sense of how to leverage AI to innovate within their organization."

    "text": "This 2-days workshop was held at the Logitech headquarters in Lausanne. It started with the basics of AI in day one and ended with topics such as multimodal learning, quantisation and RAG in day two. We had about 20 participants including some connecting from two other continents. Thanks to the supersmart participants (all section head engineers and VPs), we had an exciting and vibrant workshop. We had a lot of interesting discussions and questions.\nOne cool thing was that in the context of compute demand and GPUs, I was talking about AlexNet at the same day G. Hington recieved his well-deserved Nobel prize.\nThe highlight for me ‚Ä¶, it was certainly corporate challenges shared by the participants."

    "section": "",
    "text": "This was a 90 minutes NLP masterclass for some ML enthusiasts who met our team a few month ago at the Women in Data Science community. It started with a brief introduction to machine learning, followed by a hands-on session on text classification using Python. The goal was to build a spam detector using the SpamAssassin public email corpus. The data and codes were shared with the participants via Google Colab notebooks in a GitHub repository.\nIn the first part, we followed the classic text cleaning and preprocessing steps and trained a classifier on cleaned and tokenized data. In the second part, we used text embeddings extracted from Gecko model (Cloud Vertex AI) to train a classifier. The participants were able to compare the performance of the two classifiers and see the impact of LLM-based and context-aware text embeddings on the model performance.\nWhile using Google Colab notebooks made code sharing seamless, setting up and coordinating API access to Cloud Vertex AI for multiple participants is an issue. I opted for a quick workaround i.e.¬†provided embeddings in a CSV file, but I‚Äôd like to explore more streamlined solutions for handling authentication and quotas in future hands-on workshops."

    "section": "",
    "text": "In this engaging 2-days workshop, I began with an interactive refresher on data analysis and statistics in Python, laying a solid foundation for the more advanced topics to come. As we transitioned into Bayesian statistics and A/B testing, the excitement in the room grew as everyone realized how powerful these tools can be for making informed, data-driven decisions.\nThroughout the sessions, I highlighted the various factors that can significantly impact A/B test results, such as sample size, test duration, and even the subtle influence of data variability. The real fun began when we rolled up our sleeves and implemented A/B testing in Python using the PyMC library. Watching participants write code, run experiments, and troubleshoot their own models was incredibly rewarding.\nQuarto saved me a lot of time in preparing the workshop materials and bringing codes into slides. Also simple Shiny apps that I created and put into the slides helped me to explain some of the concepts in a easy way and engage with the participants."

This shift in mindset was a powerful lesson in the importance of data quality and problem framing, and a reminder that AI is a tool to enhance human decision-making, not a magic bullet."
