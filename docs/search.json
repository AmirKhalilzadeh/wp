It was a vibrant atmosphere in a large room with 110 seats.\nWe shared a GitHub repository to the participants that contained the python codes to run on Colab, Binder or their local machines. The room was full from start to end, and I was happy to see the enthusiasm of the participants.\nIn future I would like to have more time for the workshop to give more time for participants to work on the exercises and to interact with them."

It started with the basics of AI in day one and ended with topics such as multimodal learning, quantisation and RAG in day two. We had about 20 participants including some connecting from two other continents. Thanks to the supersmart participants (all section head engineers and VPs), we had an exciting and vibrant workshop. We had a lot of interesting discussions and questions.\nOne cool thing was that in the context of compute demand and GPUs, I was talking about AlexNet at the same day G. Hington recieved his well-deserved Nobel prize.\nThe highlight for me ‚Ä¶, it was certainly corporate challenges shared by the participants."

    "title": "Reflecting on 2024, A Year of Tools in LLM Application Development",
    "section": "",
    "text": "2024 has been a transformative year for many within the broader developer community. I have been amazed by the growth and democratization of application development tools for language models. They‚Äôve made models more accessible and enabled the creation of apps and agentic workflows. This means, barriers to the developers‚Äô community are fading away and it doesn‚Äôt take one to be a software engineer to prototype and test a toy product, before handing over things to a real developer to make a product out of it. The increasing depth and breadth of the application development space call for a more structured approach to using and maintaining these tools. Topics like AI product management have become crucial.\nBut at the same time, it doesn‚Äôt take one to be a pro hacker to scam or harm others. It‚Äôs alarmingly easy to clone a voice or face, making topics like AI security, governance, and ethics more critical than ever. So, overall and as with other tech growth periods, there has been a massive growth in both opportunities and risks, but this time in a more democratized, accessible and super fast moving way. By the way, our colleagues at EPFL had recently organized and delivered a successful 3-day course on AI product management which I hope we will see more of in the future. Language models also contirbute to their own consumption and development (e.g.¬†via Copilot), making it easier for non-developers to benefit from developer tools and speculate on their ideas before getting too much into the technical details.\n\nPrivacy Challenges in LLM Applications\nSome of the tools that I have been using or playing with this year are Langchain, Langflow, AnythingLLM, Llamaindex, OpenWebUI, Ollama, and Gradio. I started with a RAG powered chatbot that can interact with my personal webpage. I used GPT-4o-mini and a cheap and small embedding model from OpenAI (more on their embeddings here). Both can be replaced with any other LangChain-supported options. The cool part was the metadata that you can collect and trace with Langsmith e.g.¬†latency, token usage, costs per request, request and its augmented part. I used then Gradio for the UI which was easy to learn and code at no time, but needs internet connection to work!\nWhen brainstorming other potential toy applications, privacy concerns often emerged as a significant hurdle. You may want to build systems that don‚Äôt need an API or an internet connection. I was thinking about a chatbot that has my voice cloned and is available to my family so that they can get updates on me at any time during the day, times that I‚Äôm unavailable due to time zone differences; or a chatbot that can help me to take an emergency medical action in a trip where I have no internet connection; one that can help me with the home admins, e.g.¬†all insurances, bills, my consumption behaviour, etc, or one that can help me on basic health related questions.\nCommon to these ideas are locally stored data and sensitive prompts. I have already tried them or a version of them, which made me aware of the potential challenges and compromises. Running a smart model locally demands substantial computational resources, and lighter models may lack the sophistication required for more complex tasks. Fine-tuning models for specific needs requires machine power, often leading back to cloud services and, consequently, privacy concerns. Another challenge lies in building efficient RAG systems which require smart models and embeddings, resources that are not always feasible to run locally.\n\nMy Toy App for Education\nThe following screenshot showcases a chatbot app I created to act as a Continuing Education Advisor üìö. It helps users consider and decide on their education goals and paths. The assistant supports multiple languages and works on various devices.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile this is more of a curiosity-driven prototype than a polished product, it highlights the potential of these tools. Here are the ingredients:\nThe base model is a light llama 3.2. While I initially used a local instance, it struggled with inference times for complex tasks and maxed out my CPU cores, impacting other processes. I eventually moved to GrogCloud‚Äôs free tier for better performance on concurrent requests. All the admin part is done locally via OpenWebUI container in Docker. The UI is a native of Streamlit that ChatGpt and Claude kindly provided its code to me after some discussions.For now, I‚Äôve used Ngrok to provide a public URL, thanks to their free tier. I hope I can keep working on this project and make it more practical for real-world use cases.\n\nThe year 2024 has been a remarkable period of experimentation in LLM application development for many within the broader developer community. I‚Äôm excited to see what the next year holds for this fast-evolving space."

    "section": "",
    "text": "This was a 90 minutes NLP masterclass for some ML enthusiasts who met our team a few month ago at the Women in Data Science community. It started with a brief introduction to machine learning, followed by a hands-on session on text classification using Python. The goal was to build a spam detector using the SpamAssassin public email corpus. The data and codes were shared with the participants via Google Colab notebooks in a GitHub repository.\nIn the first part, we followed the classic text cleaning and preprocessing steps and trained a classifier on cleaned and tokenized data. In the second part, we used text embeddings extracted from Gecko model (Cloud Vertex AI) to train a classifier. The participants were able to compare the performance of the two classifiers and see the impact of LLM-based and context-aware text embeddings on the model performance.\nWhile using Google Colab notebooks made code sharing seamless, setting up and coordinating API access to Cloud Vertex AI for multiple participants is an issue. I opted for a quick workaround i.e.¬†provided embeddings in a CSV file, but I‚Äôd like to explore more streamlined solutions for handling authentication and quotas in future hands-on workshops."

    "text": "In this engaging 2-days workshop, I began with an interactive refresher on data analysis and statistics in Python, laying a solid foundation for the more advanced topics to come. As we transitioned into Bayesian statistics and A/B testing, the excitement in the room grew as everyone realized how powerful these tools can be for making informed, data-driven decisions.\nThroughout the sessions, I highlighted the various factors that can significantly impact A/B test results, such as sample size, test duration, and even the subtle influence of data variability. The real fun began when we rolled up our sleeves and implemented A/B testing in Python using the PyMC library. Watching participants write code, run experiments, and troubleshoot their own models was incredibly rewarding.\nQuarto saved me a lot of time in preparing the workshop materials and bringing codes into slides. Also simple Shiny apps that I created and put into the slides helped me to explain some of the concepts in a easy way and engage with the participants."
