## about me

I am a product lead at the [Continuing Education](https://www.epfl.ch/education/continuing-education/) of EPFL and UNIL. I co-lead and teach a COS program, [Applied Data Science and Machine Learning](https://www.epfl.ch/education/continuing-education/applied-data-science-machine-learning/), to private individuals and industry professionals. I also (co)-deliver on-demand [workshops](events.qmd) to companies. 

I spend my time helping people understand the underlying principles of data pipelines and machine learning, and guide them in framing their projects. I also drive strategic decision-making and shape product roadmaps within the continuing education space.
