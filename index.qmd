## about me

I manage a portfolio of learning products and a team of brilliant instructors at the [Continuing Education](https://www.epfl.ch/education/continuing-education/) of EPFL-UNIL. We design and deliver learning solutions in programming, data science and AI to help industry professionals and private individuals upskill in the fast-evolving tech landscape. I shape product strategies and roadmaps that push the boundaries of what's possible in tech education.


<!--I co-lead and teach a COS program, [Applied Data Science and Machine Learning](https://www.epfl.ch/education/continuing-education/applied-data-science-machine-learning/), 
to industry professionals and private individuals, and (co)-deliver on-demand [workshops](events.qmd) to companies in Switzerland. -->
